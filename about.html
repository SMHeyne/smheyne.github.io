        <h1>About me.</h1> <br>
          <h3 style="color: rgb(19,124,55);">My name is Sabine.</h3>
          <p>I am an enthusiastic game designer with a love for illustration and typography. I like to develop serious games and games, which include both analogue and digital components. <br><br>
          I discovered game design through my Bachelor study Intermedia Design at the Trier University of Applied Sciences. There I have studied a good basis in all media fields, then focused on the conception of interactive exhibitions  and finally specialised in the field of  Game design. </p> <br>
          <h4>My goal?</h4>
          <p>I would like to create content and convey attitudes that enhance our social interaction and help make it a little bit better. This thought has especially influenced the topic for my bachelor's thesis, in which I have developed a Game for Change which deals with the problem of plastic avoidance in everyday life.<br> <br>
          Managing chaos, patience in difficult and time-consuming activities also help me in my free time with handicrafts and bread baking. I like to communicate and structure. I do not only reach people, I can inspire and motivate them for topics, what I have already noticed in pitches or in team projects through positive feedback. <br><br>
          Among the projects I've done so far, I am especially proud of my interactive installation Schau mal!, which I created in 2017 and was shown over several months at various positions in Trier downtown.  In order to achieve this project, I was responsible for customer acquisition and communication with the shopkeepers themselves. Also the construction of the installation went easier by hand from exhibition location to exhibition location, and numerous experiences in dealing with the assignment,  customer  contact  and organization made this project particularly valuable for my personal development. <br><br>
          When I am not involved in the conception of projects, I play puzzle and management Games, as they completely divert my focus from other duties. Otherwise I'll be found project, I was responsible for customer acquisition and communication with the shopkeepers themselves.The installation was also easier to set up from exhibition location to exhibition location, and numerous experiences in dealing with orders, customers and organization made this project especially valuable for my personal development. <br><br>
          When I am not involved in the conception of projects at the moment, I play puzzles and management games best, because they completely distract my focus from other duties and make me switch off. Otherwise you will find me in the choir, because music relaxes me extremely and I enjoy the community and the togetherness.
