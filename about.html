        <h3>My name is Sabine.</h3>
        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic game designer with a love for illustration and typography. My special interest lies on applied games and hybrid games.
          <br>I discovered Game Design through my Bachelor study Intermedia Design at the Trier University of Applied Sciences. There I have studied a good basis in all media fields, then focused on the conception of interactive exhibitions  and finally specialised in the field of  Game Design.
        </p>

      <div class="twoThirds" style="order:3">
        <h3>My goal?</h3>
        <p>
          I want to create content and convey attitudes that enrich our social interaction and make it a bit better. This thought has particularly influenced the topic of my bachelor thesis, in which I developed a Game for Change that deals with the problem of plastic avoidance in everyday life. <br>
          My skills of managing chaos, patience in difficult and time-consuming activities also help me in my spare time in my hobbies: textile handicrafts and bread baking. <br>
          I like to communicate and structure. Not only do I reach people, I can get them excited about topics and motivate them - I have seen this in pitches or in team projects through positive feedback. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Among my previous projects, I'm particularly proud of my interactive installation "Schau mal!", which I created in 2017 and was on display for several months at various locations in downtown Trier.  For this project, I was responsible for customer acquisition and communication with the store owners themselves. Setting up the installation also went easier from exhibition location to exhibition location and numerous experiences in dealing with assignments, customer contact and organization made this project particularly valuable for my personal development.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not busy with projects, I love playing puzzle and management games because they completely distract me from other tasks and let me switch off. Otherwise you can find me in the choir, because music relaxes me extremely and I enjoy the community and the togetherness.
        </p>
