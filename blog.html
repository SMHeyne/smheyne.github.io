        <h2>Weekly game challenge</h2>
        <h3>recap on week 2</h3>

        <div class="" id="post-gameChallengeText">
          <p>
            Week 2 didn't work as planned. Unfortunately. <br>
            Now you might be asking: which game challenge? <br>
            As I'm trying to gain more coding skills, don't want to get rusty using Unity and learn overall new things I started a little challenge for myself. The name is quite self-explanatory. Each week – one game idea. Very basic, but always something new. <br>
            But my goals and ideas for week 2 were a bit too ambitious. I had the idea of building some gameplay in which the player flees from a thread behind, making a path for all the trapped animals and themselves. It would be a side-scroller and the perspective orthographic, 3rd person. I had the idea of fire spreading with a particle effect. I was not as crazy to think I would really visually destroy the environment. Just, when the player touches it they should loose - no HP in that early state.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted two kinds of objects in the way: trees and rocks. The player needs the right tool to use on the objects. Axe for trees and watering can for... the rocks?! Eeeh, yeah, good question. I got distracted and built a blocky watering can. I was stupidly attached to it, kind of proud. I didn't model for some years ( I really liked 3D modelling in university, but hated weight painting too much) and I had fun stacking the blocks, I guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I made a reason to use the watering can: for the the fire! You could try to save some time. But I had neither fire nor even the basic ability to pick up a tool yet. After that I focused getting the tools to use, on showing the right tool on the player, being able to switch and get rid of them. I wanted a nice script into which I could later on add more tools easily. So my script has a dictionary! It was a challenge to make it work, I learned a lot, but it was not worth the time. I could have just scraped the watering can and only use the axe ‚ just making it work. I was just reading in the book of lenses that you never built a proto with the goal of using it later. It’s just to state your idea and prove your concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead I next wanted nice UX and added a tiny animation on the watering can. It adds feedback for the player, when they pressed the button to use the tool. I think feedback is one of the most important things in good design - how else should the player learn and understand what is happening and why. But for my tough time schedule this was too much effort. I should just have added some ugly UI for now.
          </p>
          <p>
            And then I had the problem, that things didn’t work consistently when playing. Sometimes I could change the tool just fine and sometimes I couldn't.
            <br>
            At this point I was already in my proto-3-week – you might see the problem here. In the proto-2-week I needed some time to finalise and publish my week 1 proto, but this time I was still working on basic features.
            <br>
            And then multiple personal things hit, one of them was that I got sick. I still wanted to make the proto work afterwards. I wasn’t ready to give up yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now I'm on vacation and I realised: I still learned a lot! I will use these learnings for the next idea, reconsider the time frame and proto depending on that weeks schedule and just go on learning. <br>
            But for now I'm good. I failed, but it's okay.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will see my next Game Challenge Proto folder in GitHub when I'm back. <br>
            See you around!

        <h2>Website update & upgrade</h2>
        <h3>Enhancing the user experience</h3>

        <div class="descriptionDiv" id="post-websiteUpdateText">
          <p>
            Hi! <br>
            Welcome to my first actual blog entry. I guess the announcement doesn't really count. <br>
            If you have seen my website before you might have realised that it looks different now! <br>
          </p>

            <h4>Why did I do the changes?</h4>
          <p>
            My website grew organically. I had only few projects first, a short Hello at the top and then a big second page all about me. Worked somehow. <br>
            My main idea was to be able to filter my projects by tags and then only show, for example, all Unity projects. Therefore I used flexbox to programm this page. But definitely not the best flexbox and I mis-used some features. <br>
            Then I added more text at the entry of my page and a picture of mine at the side. I did this because of feedback, to add a picture to make the page look a bit friendlier. So, my website suddenly got text and then projects.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            But next I added even more text. I wanted the visitor to "meet" me, read more about me right away. – But which recruiter wants to read that much right away? That thought made me add a "TLDR" button to jump to the projects. I fixed the result, not the issue. Bad mistake. <br>
            Lately I then realised, that I never really thought about my target group. Actually an embarrassing thing to say as I focus a lot in my games on the players needs and use cases.
            But I must admit, my website before was more made for me. I wanted my projects online and wanted to assure, that a person visiting my website could read all about me, getting to know me and be really excited. Oops.<br> But why would a visitor already be so invested in my profile? At that point they didn't know about my skills yet and pictures are easier to grasp then a lot of text. <br>
            <h4>What it looked like</h4>
            Here you can see the first thing a visitor saw on a desktop PC: <br>
          </p>
            <img class="thumbnail" src="images\blog\2_websiteUpdate\OldWebsite_Frontpage.jpg" alt="Old Website version: Frontpage with text">
          <p>
            And only here, after some scrolling, you could finally see my work.
          </p>
            <img class="thumbnail" src="images\blog\2_websiteUpdate\OldWebsite_Frontpage-Projects.jpg" alt="Old Website version: Frontpage scrolled down to see projects">
          <p>
            Another bad thing: Before, you could only go to my sub-pages from the main-page in the correct section. Now I added a menu and splitted the about page into <a href="about.html">"About me"</a> and <a href="resume.html">"Resume"</a>.<br>
            So, what do you think? Is it better or worse now? Do you find my sub-pages now easier then before? <br>
            If you have some feedback on my changes, send me an email or write me on LinkedIn. I would highly appreciate it.
            Thanks for your time and see you next blog entry.
            <br>

          <p>
            I just realised how much happened during these last 9.5 months sinced I moved to Finland. <br>
            I got to know great people at Wondershop, which I can today call my friends. I attended multiple events and discussions. I learned a lot about my field, took many hours to read Rules of Play and the book of lenses and started to improve my very basic coding skills. And I would like to share some of it here on my website. I was thinking about posting on LinkedIn multiple times. But I must admit, I'm to shy to post under my own name. Give me the responsibility to post for an institution and I'm all on it. But for myself? - I'm working on it and this is my first baby step! <br>
            Maybe you come back in a week or so and there might already be something new here - let's see! <br>
