## Sheep Roll
A 2D puzzle game we developed in a team of two. The sheep tries to feed the picky baby flamingo that only eats sushi. Push the ingredients on the sushi mat in the correct order and feed the flamingo. Developed in Unity.

✏ My tasks: Game Design, Level Design, Testing

## Parlamus
It's a game concept for a serious game to teach teenagers about politics. We developed the concept in a team of three under the advice of our games professor Dominik Wilhelm at Harz University of Applied Scienes. The client was the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It's a mobile game with the basic gameplay that reminds you of the dating app tinder.

✏ My tasks: Game Design, presenations, contact person for the state parliament

This file is an example to show the impact of the decisions the player has to make in the game.

## Schau mal
Interactive installation that was visible in downtown Trier November and December 2017. Passers-by often don't realise what is happening in the corner of their eye and this way often miss the beauty of their surroundings. Fianna tries to get their attention and shows them the beauty of nature. Programmed in Processing, uses the Microsoft Kinect.

✏ My tasks: Design, advertising, communication with operators of public areas for exhibition, programming, graphics, set-up

✏ My tasks: Installation design, accessability, intern communication

The title from our small game that we developed during the "MINFF". It's a 24h game jam at Harz University of Applied Sciences for the students of the master's degree conception of media and games and the bachelor's degree media informatics. Developed in Unity.

✏ My task: colouring + testing the functionality
