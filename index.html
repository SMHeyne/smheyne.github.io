              <p>We were developing a new gaming experience for kids with a unique controller. <br>
                Players play together on a shared screen in a public venue. The goal is to create fun,shared experiences. Each venue, the so-called hub, brings something unique to the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game concluded multiple platforms, two of them were the Player Console and the here-shown Game Screen. The Game Screen is for the shared experience with other players on-site. The Player Console is for resource management, everything social and individualisation of your player character.

              <p>The unique part of the game was that the in-game and physical worlds were intertwined. Real-world activities help you progress in the game. As I first studied digital installation design and have experience with physical games, I designed how these connections work and when the players should end their digital session to continue in the real world.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, my primary responsibility in the project was the Player Console. The player handles everything personal here. The first version felt more like a tool than a part of the game, as it was less playful. Additionally, accessing all the features the player was supposed to find easily here took a lot of effort. <br>
                 I proposed a new start page that had a different layout. I suggested that based on multiple personas I made with the team's help at our test hub. I've constantly exchanged with the developers and artists implementing the changes.

              A new version of the classic from Ravensburger. Players can choose characters with unique abilities, and Moriarty has new possibilities to win the game. Block a road with Inspector Lestrade's ability or ban Moriarty from using Tram or Underground next round. But be aware: he could use the hot air balloon to escape!

            <div class="twoThirds">
              <p>When I joined the project, the two Editors working on this project already developed the new character abilities for Holmes' Team. In the old version, one person played Mister X and could only win by escaping. Now, this player plays Moriarty and can also win by committing crimes. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                But with the new player abilities, we realised during one of the many test sessions that Moriarty needs an escape strategy. These Moriarty abilities were my main tasks during the development. I chose the locations where Moriarty could land with his air balloon and helped figure out the crime scene areas on the board. <br>
                In the end, we decided to use Moriarty's start number tokens also for the landing possibilities, always having two options on one token. This way, we didn't need to set up a new layout for printing and could lower production costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end, I was even in charge of correcting the rules, coordinating with the art director for this project, checking the final print files, and writing instructions on setting up the rule book's explanation pictures.

                After a few weeks, I was in charge of this project. The Lead Game Designer reviewed my process with me weekly and advised on how to proceed. Besides that, I had absolute freedom and worked alone on the Game Design.
              </p>
              <p>
                I knew which specific forest areas I needed to include in the game and which animals the visitors could find at these. My task was to figure out the possibilities with AR and what the player could do at these sites.

                The interactions in the game are small: for example, the player searches with their phone on the trees around them for a place on which bugs could be so the woodpecker can find and eat them. <br>
                A short informational text informs the player about the specifics of the animal. Then, they can continue with the following small task. This way, the player learns much about the connections between the forest and the animals living there.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game is supposed to be played while walking through the forest, and the stations are not directly next to each other. The main focus is still experiencing nature, and the players are encouraged to search for all the details revealing the animal's activities.

              The concept was developed in the LESSoN project at the Harz University of Applied Sciences. The client was the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt with the goal of developing a game that makes politics more appealing to young people. The player swipes through decisions that influence the satisfaction, with the goal of being re-elected.

              Our team consisted of three students and our Professor, who consulted us. One was in charge of illustration and UI, one was doing Content Design and Research, and I was doing the Game Design and client communication on this project.
              
              Our main inspiration was Reigns/ Tinder. Our goal was to develop a game with a short time frame for each play session, continuous learning and some silliness in the gameplay. We wanted our players to make decisions, see the consequences and get another chance quickly.

              After multiple phone calls and iterations, we had learned a lot, and our client was satisfied with the result.

              I built several prototypes and illustrated the last version a bit, so I could import the assets to Table Top Simulator for a final round with 4 testers.
              I had to prepare all the logic connections and needed texts. Which the tiptoi then would play, to simulate the gameplay.

                SheepRoll was a project developed in a group of two within one semester.
                We’ve built a prototype which was programmed by my colleague and illustrated by me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I put a lot of time in user personas and analysing multiple game mechanics to build a game with simple rules and goals, but a challenging experience. <br>I was in charge of the overall game design, and my colleague did the level design. That also made me the primary tester. We ended up with five different levels.

              The goal of the Game Development course was to develop a game about Covid-19. The result is a maze runner where two players compete against each other as hamsters. They try to collect the required objects as fast as possible without getting or being infected in the process.

                The basic game play was decided very quickly. Be a hamster, get all the groceries, don't get sick, get out of there first. I made some flow charts, made a map with all the needed screens and then started to scribble some mockups.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our main difficulty: the team consisted of four people and we had a lack of programming knowledge. <br> One person doing the Art and UI, one person doing animations and sound, our developer and me doing Game and Level Design. Our developer had never written a line of code before. Therefore we needed to test as much as possible before in a more analogue way.<br>
                To simulate the game play I moved around the different visuals digitally just like a paper prototype. Below you can see my mockups. As the first assets for the groceries were done very early, I used those in there very soon.

              An interactive installation, which was on display for several months at three different locations in the city of Trier. <br>The protagonist Fianna imitates the movements of the pedestrians and thereupon shows her own world.

                This project was my main bachelor's degree project and I developed it on my own. I had enrolled in a course called Installation laboratory and I found it extremely fascinating. In the course we developed our own tiny digital installations and augmented reality projects in processing, a library based on java.
              </p>
              <p>
                My idea was to have people realise more what happens around them and therefore to pay more attention to their surroundings. Fianna starts to appear as soon as the Kinect tracks a person walking by. Lines appear on the screen and there is movement. When the person then stands still, she fully appears and imitates your movement. The longer you stand there, the more nature around her appears until at one point everything disappears again.

              My biggest achievements were finding 3 possibilities to exhibit my installation within the city of Trier, having all my stickers been distributed and staying within my time schedule. <br>
              Overall it was shown over a time of nearly 3 months. The actual idea was to lent it to property owners, who's shop area was currently not in use. Instead of having dark empty or covered windows, I would have liked to see my installation in there. Moving from one window within the city to another, switching weekly. <br> Unfortunately the acquisition was not that easy, but in the end I was allowed to show it in one of the biggest shopping malls in the city. <br>
              I used a small box with stickers for a rough indication on how many people have actually seen it. Fun fact: "Schau mal!" means "Take a look!" in German.

              This game was developed during the Health Game Jam in 2022. It was organised under the sign of mental health by <a href="https://games-ahead.de/5-health-game-jam/">gamesAHEAD</a> in cooperation with the Goethe-Institut and the ThaiHealth Foundation.
              The intended goal was to show, that even small decisions make a difference for the own point of view. A person that might have a mental difficulty might not be aware of the other possibilities. This way it's very hard to understand, that there might be a way out. <br>
              We hope that the little fish in this game show that a helping hand or a gesture might bring some more colour or brightness to someone elses life.

By staying at home you can protect your plants, that are endangered by a pest. If you stay out for too long they will start fading away. Grow your tree, collect new plants and virtually battle along with your friends.
